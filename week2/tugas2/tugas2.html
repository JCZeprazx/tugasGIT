          <h2>Mountain</h2>
          <p>
            The mighty chunks rise all over the world, including the oceans.
            They usually have steep, sloping sides and sharp or rounded ridges,
            and a high point, called a peak or summit. Most geologists classify
            a mountain as a landform that rises at least 1,000 feet (300 meters)
            or more above its surrounding area. A mountain range is a series or
            chain of mountains that are close together.
          </p>
          <h2>River</h2>
          <p>A river is a ribbon-like body of water that flows downhill from the force of gravity. A river can be wide and deep, or shallow enough for a person to wade across. A flowing body of water that is smaller than a river is called a stream, creek, or brook.</p>
          <p>All rivers have a starting point where water begins its flow. This source is called a headwater. The headwater can come from rainfall or snowmelt in mountains, but it can also bubble up from groundwater or form at the edge of a lake or large pond. The other end of a river is called its mouth, where water empties into a larger body of water, such as a lake or ocean. Along the way, rivers may pass through wetlands where plants slow down the water and filter out pollutants.</p>
          <h2>Forest</h2>
          <p>The word forest broadly describes an area that has a large number of trees. There are three general types of forest that exist: temperate, tropical, and boreal. Experts estimate that these forests cover approximately one-third of Earth’s surface.</p>
          <h2>Sea</h2>
          <p>
            The phrase “the Seven Seas” has been around for centuries, but that
            term really refers to different parts of the ocean and several other
            large bodies of water. There are actually more than seven seas in
            the world. But what makes a sea different from other bodies of
            water?
          </p>
          <p>
            That is not an easy question to answer, because the definition of a
            sea leaves some room for interpretation. In general, a sea is
            defined as a portion of the ocean that is partly surrounded by land.
            Given that definition, there are about 50 seas around the world. But
            that number includes water bodies not always thought of as seas,
            such as the Gulf of Mexico and the Hudson Bay
